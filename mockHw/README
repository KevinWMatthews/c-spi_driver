This folder contains mocks/simulations of the ATtiny hardware, in particular avr/*.h files and the memory registers found therein.
It enables gcc to build source and test files that have a direct hardware dependence.
It also enables us to inspect the content of the chip's simulated memory registers.

To inspect the original avr header files, see usr/lib/avr/include
